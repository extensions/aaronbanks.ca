Run `npm start` in the terminal to run the website in development mode.

```sh
# add changes in current directory
git add .
# commit them -- you'll be asked for a commit message
git commit
# push them back to github
git push
```

if you get an error pushing, it's probably because there are changes you haven't pulled, so try

```sh
git pull
```

and if you get an error read what it says.
